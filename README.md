# Video Game Sales Project
## This project is broken up into 3 parts
### 1) Jupyter Notebook project that uses the library BeautifulSoup to scrape the website 'vgchartz.com' and takes a look at video game sales data from the period of 1978-2020.<br />2) Scraped data will then be cleaned up using the Pandas library, making sure the dataset is usable and coherent.<br />3) We will then perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the cleaned data in order to try and draw useful insights on the trends of video game sales throughout its history.

### If you are interested in taking a look at my thought process in its rawest form, you can view each of my python notebook files seperated by 3 parts (Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, EDA)

### Here were some of my findings
